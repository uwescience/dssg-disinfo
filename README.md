# Using deeping learning to identify disinformation new articles online

Websites that disseminate disinformation about coronavirus likely contribute to public harm by sowing confusion and distrust as well as preventing people from taking appropariate prevention measures or engagin gin dangerous fake treatment and cures, which could result in increased virus transmission, morbidity, and mortality worldwide.

Developing a method to identify disinformation sites could mitigate these harmful effects by allowing advertisers to not fund such sites. The purpose of this project is to develop an open-source natural language processing model that can accurately classify news articles according to their risk of containing disinformation about the coronavirus.
